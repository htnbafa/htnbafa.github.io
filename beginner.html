									<h3>The Complicated Explanation:</h3> 
									<p>calories in < calories out </p>

								<h3>Dumbing it Down:</h3>

<p>you’re a pro eater, you know how to cram a bunch of tasty delicious food into your body and not use any of it </br>

								so the big secret everyone in the fitness industry doesn’t want you to know about is:</br>
						YOU HAVE TO EAT LESS
how?

						by not putting as much food into your mouth.</br>

 

 

pick from the following list of food you can eat less of (or completely eliminate from your diet):
<ul>
	<li>those “healthy” low calorie snacks you eat every hour on the hour</li>
	<li>the bowl of soup made of low-fat ranch dressing and croutons you call a salad</li>
	<li>soft drinks</li>
						</ul>
if completely cutting any of these items from your diet is too much for your fatass, try working up to it, just eating smaller amounts or eating less frequently</br>

for example, instead of a granola bar every time you play with your phone, try only eating a granola bar every other time, then every other day, and so on</br>

						don’t worry, your body won’t go into starvation mode, scout’s honors</br>

 

						If you do this for a month and have not lost any weight, ask yourself this:</br>

“have I added new snacks to my diet, drink more sodas, eat more ranch dressing to compensate for the smaller amounts I am eating of other items? </br>

If not, you’re a god damn liar
